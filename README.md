# Credit-Card-Spam-Detection

Hello, I have made a Machine Learning Project using Logistic Regression 
It is used to predict the Detection of Credit Card Fraud Transaction

The input format is: 
Time: Time of Transaction
The next 8 inputs are: The result of a Principal component analysis (PCA) Dimensionality reduction to protect user identities and sensitive features
Generaly its a number with a decimal point upto 10 places
Amount: The transferred Amount

To run the code,
Download the CSV file -> take the location of the file -> And,
Add that location in the place of 'file' variable present in the medical-insurance-ml.ipynb file.
